# Counter App 

## Intro
<hr>
This is a basic TUI counter app I made with a tutorial, the main purpose of this project is just to get a bit more used to golang.

## The Stack
<hr>

- **GOLANG**
- **CHARM TUI FRAMEWORK**

## Features
### Counting up
You can increase the counter with w and the up arrowkey
### Counting Down
You can Decrease the counter with s and the down arrowkey
### Negative Numbers
Due to a lot of requests the counter actually supports negative numbers aswell  [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/not-a-bug-a-feature.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## Setup
### Building from source
**You will need**
- A working System (assuming you can read this you probably have one)
- A golang compiler installed
- a terminal
- this repository

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository on your working system
2. either build it with ```go build .``` or to avoid compilation just run it with <br>
```go run .```
3. Enjoy the counter application

## WHY?
<hr>

Just having a counter seems a bit pointless, doesnt it? I actually made this project to get better with golang and its syntax aswell as becoming more familiar with bubbleteas architecture. It was quite a new experience working with the ELM like architeture and i found it very interesting to get to know this new concept.
